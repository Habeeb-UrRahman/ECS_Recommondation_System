# Soil Attributes Recommendation System
This system is built on a random dataset of attribute values for some of the 50 specific home grown plants. These attribute are essential in determining the quality of the soil. The attribute values can be specific to each of the plants and can determine the optimal values in the soil for the plants to grow in a healthy manner.

Our system uses this dataset and provides a user interface built using Python Streamlit to allow the user to choose any of the 50 plants that they plan on growing at their home and the system will provide the optimal values of the specified attributed to maintain a healthy growth environment for the plants. The system can even use multiple plant values and determine a safe value specific for multiple plants to be grown in the same soil.

The attributes we use here are:
- Turbidity
- pH
- Rainfall level
- Nitrogen level
- Phosphorus level
- Potassium level
- Humidity
